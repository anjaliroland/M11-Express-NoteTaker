## 📚 Description 

For this challenge we were tasked with adding the back end code for an application that can be used to write and save notes. We were given starter code that included completed front end code, it was then our job to use an Express.js back end to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. After building the back end we needed to connect the two and then deploy the application to Heroku.
